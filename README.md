# Third-Eye
Third Eye is an ios news application to enhance user experience with software advancements such as object detection, speech recognition, speech synthesizers and NLP. The end product is a smartphone application with multimodal inputs – touch, gestures and voice, enabling new use case for the application and making it more accessible to the users. The application is also designed to help visually impaired users using voice and gestures. Voice and gesture controls are implemented to be effective to visually impaired users as well.


<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Application involves gesture detection & recognition which is done using Yolo3 model which stands for “You Only Look Once”. Darknet, an open source framework serves as the basis of YOLO.</p>
<p>The training dataset comprises of images of the three classes namely Stop, Resume and Microphone.</p>
<p>The model is then converted using coreml tools to make the model compataible with the ios application.</p>

<h2>Model Inputs</h2>
